# mispace-hackathon

This is Nick's hackathon project for the MISpace Ice Prediction Hackathon.

To view the website that I built, please go to the url https://mispace-hackathon.vercel.app/

This project was first started in a google colab where I created a linear regression model to predict the ice cover. To view that notebook, you can upload the ipynb into your personal colab. 

The website was built in react and consists of the leaflet open source mapping software. I used that to create the underlying mapping and added an overlay of the ice predictions on top. This data came from the jsons in the /public/public folder. 

If you have any questions about this project, I urge you to reach out to me via email at alkema@umich.edu. Thanks for taking a look at my project :).
